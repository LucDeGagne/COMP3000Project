List of things to do:

. Job control, IPC, I/O redirect and co-processes.
. C-like scripting language based on tcc -run.
. Switch to dietline
. Since we should have functions, there's no need for aliases at all.
. Handle hypen character before the program name (login shell).
. Startup file.
. Allow a meta-directory for the cd bultin command which allows to go up as
